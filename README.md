# Tweepy-CNN-Bot
Twitter bot that reposts current CNN articles. Uses Tweepy and Selenium to work. The code that is uploaded is made for you to be able to replace your own twitter information and replace the website with whatever you want on it with it. From there you should be able to get it running. 

Note:
-Your Twitter developer account must be set to "Read and Write"
-Selenium drivers must be installed elsewhere

This project was made for educational and hobby purposes. No profit or sales have been made during this process.
